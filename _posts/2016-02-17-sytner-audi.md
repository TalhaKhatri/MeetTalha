lead_text: "Developed the mobile app for TechChaps, a UK based software consultancy for their client, Sytner. Sytner is one of UK's largest car retailer. Their web application was in Vue.js so I was tasked with converting it to a responsive mobile app using a plugin which compiled the web app to a cordova mobile app."
